# Fluent Python | Code Sandbox

This repository contains my code snippets, exercises, and notes created while working through **"Fluent Python"** by Luciano Ramalho. 

The goal of this project was to dive deep into Python's internal mechanics and advanced features.

### 📚 Topics Covered
* **Python Data Model** (Magic methods, protocols)
* **Object-Oriented Idioms** (Interfaces, Abstract Base Classes)
* **Metaprogramming** (Descriptors, Class Decorators, Metaclasses)
* **Control Flow** (Iterators, Generators, Async/Await)

### ⚠️ Status
**Completed & Archived.**
The code here represents my learning journey throughout the book. The repository is now read-only.
